# ThornReplacer
a simple MS Word add-in that replaces the modern English "th" with the middle English equivalent letter Thorn (Þ, þ, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorn_(letter) ).
If you're a medieval-language enthusiast and want to write texts in it but don't always want to copy and paste the character in, this handy add-in is for you!
Simply write the text as you would on a regular keyboard (latinized) and before the document saves, the add-in replaces all latinized "th"s with the Thorn letter.
You just need to download and run the installer and it will automatically be added to Word and activated.
The add-in is easily turned on or off in the Word add-ins manager under file>options>add-ins>Manage/Go

It only replaces characters if the paragraph they're in is classified as UK English!!!
